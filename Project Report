2) Implementation details. 
- The integrated_render.py script implements the phishing-simulation generation workflow by combining template rendering, web scraping, 
file generation, and directory provisioning into a single automated pipeline. The script first determines all project-relative paths,
creates required folders (such as the Inbox and Inbox/css directories), and ensures that each required CSS file exists—copying them
from the project root or generating minimal fallback styles if necessary. It then loads the HTML email template, updates all CSS
references to point to the Inbox structure, and prepares a Jinja2 renderer for generating personalized messages. Employee data is 
obtained by scraping a simulated corporate website hosted on GitHub Pages, where the script extracts names, inferred emails, job roles,
and departmental associations using BeautifulSoup. Each employee is mapped to a phishing scenario, and this information is injected into
the Jinja2 template to produce a tailored phishing email saved under a sanitized filename. The script also generates an inbox_viewer.html
interface containing statistics and clickable links to each generated email, and automatically opens this viewer in a browser. Throughout
the process, the implementation includes error handling, fallback mechanisms, dynamic CSS injection, and clear console logging to support
reproducibility and debugging.

3) Testing and validation results. 
- Testing was implemented by providing pseudo code for data collection, server hosting, and key logging users. The testing was 
committed  inside each of their respective branches, landing-page and data-collection branch. The code was then validated by running
it separate from main to conclude that it’s working. Neatly,  we had to merge the code together as in, ensure that everything runs
together. So we created a file called integrated_render.py for this task. To test integrated_render, there is a function called 
get_fallback_data() to use data if inbox failed to be created.  

4) Security considerations. 
- Disclaimers were added to the html pages to notify users that the project is a phishing simulation
- Fake emails were used
- Fake company was used and posted on site: https://xaviermedy.github.io/

5) Limitations and future improvements.
- Using Kali Linux tool theHarvester instead of beautifulsoup for data reconnaissance
- theHarvester posed many issues trying to access Githubpages site
- SpiderFoot tool can be used as an alternative
- Using a purchased domain for our fake company

6) A detailed description of any outside libraries used.
- Flask==3.0.0 (Used for landing page hosting and keylogging)
- Jinja2==3.1.2 (Used for email templates)
- beautifulsoup4==4.12.2 (Used for OSINT data reconnaissance)
- requests==2.31.0 (Used for post request data from landing page)

-------User Manual-------
Download Kali Linux from kali.org
Clone the Repository inside Kali Machine git clone https://github.com/XavierMedy/Modern-Phishing-Simulation.git cd Modern-Phishing-Simulation

Set Up Python Environment

Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Navigate to folder directory Run: python scripts/integrated_render.py

Start the server: python server.py

Keystroke data recorded in username and password box
Without the server running, landing page will not load and keystrokes wont be recorded

Ensure there are keyboard_logs (keystroke data)

Without keystroke data, calculate_phish_rate.py will not run
Run: python calculate_phish_rate.py
